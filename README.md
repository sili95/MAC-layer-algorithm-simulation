Except for the figure about throughput in figures6-h-cw, all the other pictures are matlab figures. 
the matlab figures which store the complete information of the data, and the statistical information, such as mean value, maximum value and variance.can be viewed through the matlab tools.
The throughput data of HCW algorithm is too large to upload, but it can be obtained through the uploaded code.
The code has instructions on how to do this and all data can be generated from the supplied code.
